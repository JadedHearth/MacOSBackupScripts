# MacOS Backup Scripts

This repository contains a set of scripts that backs up all (disclaimer: not yet) of my important files to iCloud Drive. This is designed specifically for my MacOS system, and is not applicable anywhere else without adaptation.
Requires the CLI for: zsh (modules: colors), rsync, brctl, etc.

Would not recommend for usage as iCloud Drive is very unreliable in usage.
